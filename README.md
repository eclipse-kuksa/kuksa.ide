# Kuksa-IDE Repo

## Che-6

This repository contains documentation and implementation to setup an Eclipse Che (6.10) Kuksa instance under `/che-6/`, which eases the development of Kuksa In-Vehicle applications as well as Kuksa Cloud services.
Therefore, the default Eclipse Che version is extended by different Kuksa-specific components:

*  Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) stack with Yocto support:
AGL represents an automotive specific Linux distribution specifically designed as open software stack for connected car scenarios.
The following video features an example on how to use the Kuksa-IDE for developing AGL applications and services running on a [Rover](https://wiki.eclipse.org/APP4MC/Rover)

## VSCode-Extensions

Additionally, under `/VSCode-Extensions/`, 4 VSCode extensions are provided which ease Eclipse Kuksa In-Vehicle App and Cloud service development activities. 
Such extensions can be used (a) locally as part of a VSCode instance, or (b) along with Eclipse Che 7 and Theia or (c) Gitpod together with kubernetes and docker (with root privileges) in order to employ a cloud-based IDE.
Hence, the set of Visual Studio Code extensions establish an end-to-end workflow from the IDE via the Appstore and Hawkbit to the device. 
The extensions can be installed from .vsix files and provide:

* *Initialize Workspace*
* *Generate Docker Image*
* *Configure Kuksa Environment(YAML)*
* *Publish to Appstore*
